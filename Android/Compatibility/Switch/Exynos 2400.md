| Game                                 | Works | Notes                            | Device           |
|--------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| New Super Mario Bros Deluxe          | 游릭      | Perfect performance, 60fps, no stutters no glitches                  |                  |
| Super Mario 3D World                 | 游릭      | again 60 fps, perfect performance, no stutters, however at certain points it felt like lighting is dimming for a second, not sure if game issue, intended or device related                                 |                  |
| Super Mario Bros Wonder              | 游릭      | Much like New Bros, perfect 60 fps, no glitches or stutters                                 |                  |
| Bastion                              | 游릭      | FPS counter says 60, but somehow it doesn't feel like 60 all the time, despite what counter says. Still perfectly playable.                                 |                  |
| Cosmic Star Heroine                  | 游릭      | Well Grandia 1 didn't work, but this old school indie JRPG works flawlessly                            |                  |
| Tunic                                | 游릭      | 30 FPS locked, works fine, with minor shadow glitches at certain points (granted could be intentional I don't remember how it looked on switch)                            |                  |
| Witcher 3: Wild Hunt                 | 游리      | Surprisingly holds 30 fps, however if you look at light source like Sun everything is white, stabilizes until new source of light appears. Will try to tinker some more with settings to check if it can be brought to normal and still playable. This game only ran on Yuzu latest version. Sudachi and Citron hang on the very first screen.                      |                  |
| Divinity: Original Sin 2             | 游댮      | Starts loading with 30 fps, loading bar goes up fast, but before it completes all 3 emulators tested crash.                                 |                  |
| Luigi's Mansion 2 HD                 | 游릭      | Works, locked 30 fps, minor texture glitches                            | Device           |
| Super Mario RPG                      | 游릭      | Works, 60fps, no issues                             | Device           |
| Unicorn Overlord                     | 游릭      | FPS goes between 40 and 60 fps, probably due to shaders, no glitches, not much stuttering                            | Device           |
| Pokemon Sword                        | 游릭      | Stable 30fps, inside and outside, some fps drops when loading new scenes, no graphical glitches (Ocassional glitched textures on further testing, usually disappear once new area loads in)                            | Device           |
| Diablo 3                             | 游릭      | Takes a bit to start, ocassional slowdown when typing in name or choosing class (got me sweating for a moment), opening section perfect 60fps (even when tons of zombies spawn in front of the gate)                            | Device           |
| Stray                                | 游릭      | Works at 30 fps, minor stutters here and there, not too bad.                            | Device           |
| Yomawari collection                  | 游릭      | Perfect 60fps, no other comment to make                            | Device           |
| Super Mario Odyssey                  | 游리      | Game works at 60fps, a lot of missing textures and wrong colors                            | Device           |
| Grandia 2                            | 游리      | From collection, works between 25 at 30 fps, some sound buggs not matching text, playable I guess.                            | Device           |
| Dragon Quest XI-echoes of the elusive age                                 | 游리      | Perfect 30 fps, however lense flare glitches sometimes make screen impossbile to see, not often could be playable 100%, tried different res, tried adding some AA, nothing helps. 2D mode seems to work fine tho                            | Device           |
| Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom              | 游리      | Stable 60 fps, a lot of flickering that can be distracting, but game seems playable                            | Device           |
| EA FC24                              | 游댮      | Can't even start, emulator just crashes                            | Device           |
| Zelda: BOTW                          | 游댮      | Runnable with update, no longer crashes, but textures do not load!                            | Device           |
| Skyrim                               | 游댮      | Starts up at 30fps, crashes before intro cutscene                            | Device           |
| Grandia 1                            | 游댮      | From collection, just black screens                            | Device           |
| Divinity: Original sin 2             | 游댮      | Starts loading, then emulators just crash                            | Device           |
| Doom 2016                            | 游댮      | Unplayable, Yuzu gets into main menu, crashes when loading in tutorial area                            | Device           |
| Fire Emblem: Three Houses            | 游댮      | Starts of great, crashes when you have to start first battle after opening cinematic/dialogue                            | Device           |
| Signalis                             | 游댮      | Crashes after you exit the elevator after intro sequence                            | Device           |
