- Device: Lenovo Y700 2023
- Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1
- RAM: 12GB
- If Game Doesn't Boot
  - Launch Vulkan version (doom2016vk.exe)
  - If you switched to OpenGL and now doesn't boot:
    - Gamehub > Game Settings > Command Line and type:
      - `+r_renderapi -1`
  - Install vcredist2015
  - Winlator users: Don't use Turnip 25.x.x
- Use adreno 805.0 driver for [better performance](https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1iuym1w/latest_qualcomm_driver_fixed_texture_issues_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
- To Fix Pixelated Textures:
  - Gamehub > Game Settings > Compatibility > Translation Params > Disable "CallRet".
  - Recommended Preset: Fast
  - Winlator Users: Performance Preset with CallRet disabled.
- Older version of the game has faster performance than newer one
- Proton x64 has faster loading speed than Wine and was used. Proton arm has lower performance (it uses fexemu instead of box64)
- Other Notes
  - There are about ~10% FPS difference between Low and Ultra preset. I used low with all post process features on. Disable self shadow, it's bugged.
  - I played the game at 1280x800 resolution with 30 or 40 FPS cap via Gamehub. I recommend to increase "sharpening" level in the game settings
